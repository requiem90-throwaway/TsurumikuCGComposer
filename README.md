## Instructions
After installing a Tsurumiku game, navigate to the game directory, e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\鉄と裸`.

Use a tool such as `crass` or `arc_conv` to extract the `data.xp3` and `image.xp3` files.

Run `CGCompose.exe`. It will ask you for 2 things.
The `pictureMode.ks` file, which can be found in `...\data.xp3~\system_scenario` and the path to the image folder (from extracting `image.xp3`).

`pictureMode.ks` contains the composing information.

After clicking `OK`, the tool will start composing the CG.
